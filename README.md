### Summary
---
:skull: For details please refer to `package.json`...  
:skull: I did not use Mr. Sheriff's `.NET 5` WebAPI... I wrote a dirty `mongodb` `mongoose` API to get the base of the work done. For absolutley no particular reason...  
:skull: I ran through Modules 7 and 8... but did not do the additional API features... I just looked and listened.
